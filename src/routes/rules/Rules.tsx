          <p>
            Mage Terra is a turn based game, the main goal is to place the same
            coloured dominoes together to score more points than your
            opponent(s).
          </p>

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-10">Starting a game</h1>
        <div className="mt-10 w-full  text-justify text-lg">
          <p>
            Mage Terra can be played with 2-6 players either with friends, or
            randos. Choose a name and avatar, then click the "I'm ready!" button
            to save them. Only the host can start the game.

        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-10">How to place dominos?</h1>
        <div className="mt-10 w-full  text-justify text-lg">
          <p>
            You choose one domino each round. You can only place it next to the
            same colored domino and you can rotate it beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            You gain points for the biggest connected area per color. Earn the
            most points to win. Thats it! Pretty easy, right?
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">Here is an example:</p>
          <div className="flex  items-center gap-4 my-2">
            <img
              alt="example"
              src={"examples/domexample.webp"}
              className="rounded-md"
              height={400}
              width={400}
            />
            <p className="mb-4">
              As you see, there are five connected green squares here. So, this
              green area counts as 5 points.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>There are three special square types:</p>
          <div className="flex  items-center gap-4 my-2">

              height={100}
              width={100}
            />
            <p>
              Tower. The Mage Tower is your starting point. Any colored domino
              can be connected to the Tower square.{" "}

            />
            <p>
              Ruin. Ruins are like holes in the board - they don't count as
              points, and you can't connect anything to them.

            <p>
              Star. Stars are important: they double your points for that color
              block which they are in! Also, no matter its size, an area with a
              star in it always counts for points. Here's an example for stars:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="flex  items-center gap-4 my-2">
            <img
              alt="example"
              src={"examples/starexample.webp"}
              className="rounded-md"
              height={200}
              width={200}
            />
            <p className="mb-4">
              There are four connected pink squares, and one star within. This
              means that the player gets 4*2=8 points for this pink area.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-10">Scores & Scoreboard </h1>
        <div className="mt-10 w-full  text-justify text-lg">
          <p>
            You gain 1 point per square from the largest area of every color. If
            you have stars in your realm, your areas with stars get counted too.
            If your biggest area contains a star, it only gets counted once. In
            case of equal areas, one with star: only the starred area earn
            points.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Below the scoreboard you can switch through every players' current
            map, so you can check how mighty their realms are truly. In the
            domino choosing phase, the points on the scoreboard are replaced
            with the players' arcanes (see below).
          </p>
        </div>
        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-10">Domino choosing</h1>
        <div className="mt-10 w-full  text-justify text-lg">
          <p>
            At the beginning of a round, every player chooses a domino in turns.
            The order of selecting is calculated with arcanes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The arcane indicates how many squares you have of the current color.
          </p>
          <img
            alt="example"
            src={"examples/arcanexample.webp"}
            className="rounded-md mt-4 mb-2"
            height={220}
            width={220}
          />
          <p>
            So for example if your entire board has 4 blue squares, and village
            (blue) is the current arcane, you have 4 arcanes!
          </p>
          <img
            alt="example"
            src={"examples/roundbarexample.webp"}
            className="rounded-md mt-4 mb-2"
            height={300}
            width={300}
          />
          <p>
            On the roundbar, you can see the next arcanes. They change every two
            rounds, and they are random, you can get the same arcanes in a game.
          </p>

          <p>
            In both game modes, if the host quits, a new host will be chosen
            randomly. Normal play rooms wait five minutes, if the game is not
            started by then, the room gets deleted.
